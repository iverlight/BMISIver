    <h2>About Tottenham Hotspur</h2>
    <p>Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, founded in 1882, is one of the most storied clubs in English football. The club was established by a group of local schoolboys from the Hotspur Cricket Club in Tottenham, North London. Originally named Hotspur FC, they initially played friendly matches and were admitted to the Southern League in 1895.</p>
    <p>In 1901, Spurs became the first non-League club to win the FA Cup, defeating Sheffield United 3-1. This victory marked a significant milestone in the club's early history and laid the groundwork for their reputation in English football. Over the following decades, Spurs would gain notoriety for their attacking style and commitment to developing local talent, contributing to the club's enduring legacy.</p>
    <p>By the 1920s, Tottenham had established itself as a force in English football, earning its first League title in 1951 and continuing to build a passionate fan base. The club's early history is characterized by a blend of local community spirit and ambition, which continues to define its identity today.</p>
